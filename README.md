## Welcome to the world of containerization!
This Template is a mono-repo for a full-stack application utilizing next.js for the frontend and Django on the back end. It also uses Firebase for authentication. It is containerized with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker/) to create a streamlined development environment for any workflow.

## Getting Started

### What is Containerization?
From [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/):

>A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

>Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers â€“ images become containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.

### Why use Docker for this purpose?
